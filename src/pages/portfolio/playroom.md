This project gave me the opportunity to bring out my inner child. I wanted the bright toys and colorful books to stand out in this space. I purposely selected a neutral background with lots of cozy and soft textures. The contrast was brought in by pieces like the leather tufted ottoman, which offers functionality and durability without sacrificing style.

This playroom is not only for playing. A large work surface with easy access storage bins dedicates a study spot for homework or crafts. The bench seat offers a more intimate reading nook or a seat for Mom + Dad to help with homework. Storage is key to keeping all the toys tucked away. With accessible bins, clean up time is easy!
