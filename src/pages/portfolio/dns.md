Tech companies are typically ahead of the game when it comes to knowledge and products in the technological world. We created an office space that aligns with the this as well as the companies design aesthetic. 

The reception has an iconic ceiling and wall metal perferated illuminated 

First impressions are most important. Upon first entering the DNS office, the reception captivates the companies work with a perforated ceiling and wall panel installation. This panel symbolizes the flow and transfer of data, a key factor in the day-to-day work at DNS. A custom reception desk aligns with the dynamic and modern design aesthetic. The juxtaposition of the dark ceiling and metal ceiling structure is continued in the floor design. Branding is found throughout the office with bold and complimentary colors. Collaborative customer facing zones and public areas are highlighted with bright orange accents. Private offices are more toned down and neutral.
