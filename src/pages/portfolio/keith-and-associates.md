The KEITH office stands out from all the other projects I worked on. The creative landscape & civil engineering company desired a raw, natural look. Natural light illuminates the space. Linear forms in the ceiling divide and circulate your perspective. Industrial style lighting is throughout the office. Collaborative areas have exposed ceilings, writable walls and drop pendant light fixtures. Rust accent walls highlight the conference room & main focal wall. Plants provide color and greenery. Height adjustable workstations, flex landing zones, and mobile collab spaces provide workspace flexibility. A phone booth provides acoustic privacy for private phone calls. This space encourages raw construction materials with imperfections.
