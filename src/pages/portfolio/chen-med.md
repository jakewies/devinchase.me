This executive office campus brings the beauty and casualness of nature indoors to an unexpected location. Private offices are strategically placed around the perimeter wall, utilizing the light. Dramatic focal points and collaborative areas are located in the center of the office. Immediately after entering, you are greeted by an open plank wooden structure with lowered ceilings for more privacy.
