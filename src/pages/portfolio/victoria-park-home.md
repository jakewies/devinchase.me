This large scale waterfront home is located in the ever eclectic neighborhood of Victoria Park. The materials in this home are nothing short of glamour and luxury. With multiple layers of sophisticated patterns, neutral tones and plush velvets, this home is sure to bring the feeling of royalty.

The large scale and low contrast of the wallcovering throughout the home keeps if bright and decorative without being overwhelming. Focal areas were created throughout the home with bold color lounges or dramatic marble top table. Besides the bold colors of the furniture and accessories, the accents of botanicals really bring the space to life.
