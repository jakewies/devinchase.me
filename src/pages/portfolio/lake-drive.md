Designing a model home for future buyers is quiet the blank canvas. We were able to collaborate with the architect and the builder for both the exterior and interior of the home. The exterior West Indies style fits right into the Delray neighborhood, while still standing out with its fresh clean look. Tongue and groove wood on the exterior fascia compliment the dark bronze window trim. Florida native plants accent the property with lush greens and small pops of color.

Stepping inside the home, the details are sure to stand out. Natural wood beams accent the corridor from end to end. Crisp white walls and dark wood floors are throughout the home, making it appear even larger than it is. Bedrooms are generously sized and connected to a bathroom with modern white hexagon tile floors with white subway tiled walls. This open floor plan creates the ideal living space.
