Creating a fresh and energetic interior environment for a company that prides themselves on innovation and purpose gave Walker Design the motive for Fattmerchant’s headquarters in Downtown Orlando. This local start-up company set roots in Orlando six years ago and since then has expanded to be one of the nation’s top financial tech leaders. Having significantly outgrown their space, Fattmerchant partnered with Walker Design to help redefine their brand standards, reinforce their unique office culture, and strive to continue increasing their innovation throughout the office. 

The facilities added in this office align with their company culture, they work hard and play hard. The office is equipped with an in-house training room, to educate new hires and existing employees with company updates. The teamwork doesn’t stop there, the office includes an on-site Fitness Center as another amenity for employees. The exposed ceilings are painted a bold Fattmerchant orange accompanied by oversized, contrasting, pendant lights. Lounge areas are located throughout the office, offering a casual space to have a quick meeting or sit with a laptop to check emails. These lounge areas are designated by an interlocking flooring pattern, symbolizing the connection of nature with concrete. The concentrated zones of green carpet anchor the main seating areas, gradually fading back out into grey neutrals. Linear lights in the ceiling follow the same direction, connecting these two planes. Natural materials and textures are used to off-set the bold colors.

The core hub of collaboration is the Employee Cafe, which is located in the center of the open office. The open floorplan allows for flexible use of the space. It can host an impromptu all-hands meeting, or a 5 O’clock post-work happy hour. The bright exposed ceiling makes the space feel energetic and inviting. Oversized light fixtures and the sculptural island feature accentuates this dynamic space. 

The Open Office area was strategically planned out, to avoid a sea of workstations. It is adjacent to large floor-to-ceiling windows, which provide abundant natural light. The overall layout of the open office area is accessible from all areas and provides space for the company to grow. Workstations are interrupted by smaller collaborative 4 person meeting tables and larger conference rooms for internal staff meetings. These conference rooms are saturated with Fattmerchant’s signature orange color. This bold orange folds down the wall and is incorporated into the carpet planks.

Overall, the newly designed Fattmerchant office mirrors its company culture. It is quite impressionable, innovative, and energizing!

Through materiality, finishes and architectural accents, the company culture of Fattmerchant is captured.
