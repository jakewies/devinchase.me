This project allowed me to think out of the box (pun intended!) . Blue Grace Logistics was one of the first projects I collaborated on at Jewel Toned Interiors. With approximately 52,000 square feet, there is a ton of areas to get creative! Especially when this client has a fun company culture. The energy and team feel with Blue Grace is heavily present. Many collaborative areas are scattered throughout the office to allow for casual spontaneous meetings. This office is truly unique and one of a kind, custom large scale graphics were a must.
